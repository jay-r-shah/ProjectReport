\chapter{Problem Statement}
\thispagestyle{plain}

The scheduling problem of chemical processes is defined as follows. Given
\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
\item production recipes (i.e. the processing times for each task at the suitable units, and the amount of the materials required for the production of each product)
\item available equipment and their maximum capacities
\item material storage limitations
\item production requirement
\item time horizon under consideration,
\end{enumerate}
determine
\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
\item the optimal sequence of tasks taking place in each unit
\item the amount of material being processes at each time in each unit
\item the processing time of each task in each unit
\end{enumerate}
so as to minimize the makespan or maximize the overall profit. \\
There may be sources of uncertainty in the scheduling problem such as:
\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
\item the processing times of tasks
\item the task yields
\item market demands
\end{enumerate}
The following notation is defined: \\
\textbf{Indices} \\
$i$ = tasks \\
$j$ = units  \\
$s$ = states  \\
$u$ = utilities \\
\textbf{Sets} \\
$\mathcal{J} = $ Set of available processing tasks \\
$\mathcal{S} = $ Set of states (materials) \\
$\mathcal{S} = $ Set of utilities \\
$\mathcal{I} = $ Set of processing tasks \\
$\mathcal{I}_j = $ Set of processing tasks that can be performed in unit $j$\\
$\mathcal{I}_s^p = $ Set of tasks that produce state $s$\\
$\mathcal{I}_s^c = $ Set of tasks that consume state $s$\\
$\mathcal{I}_u = $ Set of tasks that consume utility $u$\\
$\mathcal{I}^{zw} = $ Set of tasks that produce a zero-wait state \\
\textbf{Parameters} \\
$\alpha_i = $ Fixed processing time of task $i$ \\
$\beta_i = $ Processing time of task $i$ per unit batch \\
$\gamma_{iu} = $ Fixed consumption of utility $u$ by task $i$ \\
$\delta_{iu} = $ Consumption of utility $u$ by task $i$ per unit batch \\
$\rho_{is} = $ proportion of state $s$ in the total production/consumption by task $i$ \\
$B_i^{\text{min}} = $ minimum capacity for task $i$ in unit $j$ \\
$B_i^{\text{max}} = $ maximum capacity for task $i$ in unit $j$ \\
$U_u^{\text{max}} = $ maximum availability of utility $u$ \\
$S_{s0} = $ Initial amount of state $s$ \\
$S_{s}^{\text{max}} = $ maximum storage capacity for state $s$ \\
$D_s = $ Demand of state $s$ at the end of horizon \\
$P_s = $ Price of state $s$ \\
$H = $ Horizon
